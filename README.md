# Exile
Handmade-style voxel engine &amp; game. Currently working on a re-write privately :^).

[Blog](https://thenumbat.github.io/)

Objective is to create a featureful low-level programming environment & voxel game engine with minimal libraries, to dig into and perfect its systems, and to create a modded-minecraft-like game on top of the engine.

Goals:
   - High quality graphics (lighting, render distance, fast movement, large worlds)
   - Interesting and variable procedural terrain & feature generation
   - Powerful &amp; complex player-managed systems (e.g. modded minecraft/factorio)
   - Smooth multiplayer and efficient servers
   - Flexible &amp; powerful modding support

### Build

Install [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html) and [ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases) if necessary.

Commands are run in the repository root.

Windows:

```
meson build
meson configure build -D buildtype=debugoptimized
ninja -C build
```

Linux - ubuntu/debian (probably works, but only with clang):

```
sudo apt install clang libclang-dev libsdl2-dev ninja-build
pip3 install meson
```
```
CXX=clang++ meson build
meson configure build -D buildtype=debugoptimized -D platform=sdl
ninja -C build
```

### Run

In the top level directory:

```
cd data
..\build\main.exe
```

### Tools
- Engine & Game:
  - C+: C with member functions, function/operator overloading, lambdas, and templates (no STL, no exceptions, minimal RAII, minimal inheritance)
  - Custom standard library (data structures, threading, type info, serialization, platform, allocators)
  - Win32/Unix APIs
  - SSE4.2
- Assets:
  - STB media libraries
  - C++14/STL
- Metaprogram:
  - libclang for C++ parsing
  - C++14/STL
